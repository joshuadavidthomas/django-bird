## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Improved handling of boolean attributes to support all forms of Django template syntax and string values. The attribute name alone (`disabled`), explicit booleans (`disabled=True`), or string values (`disabled="True"`) all work as expected - rendering just the attribute name when true and omitting it when false.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Created `{% bird:prop %}` tag for defining properties within components. These operate similarly to the `{{ attrs }}` template context variable, but allow for setting defaults. Any attributes passed to a component will override the prop's default value, and props defined in a component template are automatically removed from the component's `attrs`. Props are accessible in templates via the `props` context variable (e.g. `{{ props.id }}`)

## [0.2.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains a breaking change. See the Changed section for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added support for dynamic component names in `{% bird %}` tag. Component names can now be variables, e.g. `{% bird component_type %}` where `component_type` is a variable in the template context.

### Changed

- Reversed template resolution order to prefer component-specific templates over generic ones.

  For example, given a component named `button`, the previous resolution order was:

  1. `button.html`
  2. `button/button.html`
  3. `button/index.html`

  The new resolution order is:

  1. `button/button.html`
  2. `button/index.html`
  3. `button.html`

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed rendering of flat attributes in `{% bird %}` component templates. Previously, a small mistake in trying to render `boolean` values caused no attributes to be rendered. E.g. `{% bird foo disabled=True %}` should have been rendered using `{{ attrs }}` inside the `foo` bird component as just `disabled` -- instead nothing was being rendered, even `key="value"` attributes.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Created `{% bird %}` tag for creating reusable components in Django templates.
- Created `{% bird:slot %}` tag for defining and using named slots within components.
- Included a custom template compiler for compilation and caching of Bird components. This is essentially a no-op for now and just there as a stub for future changes.
- Created a custom template loader for integration with django-bird's compiler and Django's template engine.
- Added support for nested components and dynamic slot rendering.
- Initial configuration of the library through the `settings.DJANGO_BIRD` dictionary, including these settings:
  - `COMPONENT_DIRS` - List of directories to search for components
  - `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG` - Boolean to enable/disable auto-configuration
