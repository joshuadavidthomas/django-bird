## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.2]

### Security

- Normalize paths in asset manifest to prevent leaking system-specific information like Python version and installation paths

### Fixed

- Fixed asset URL handling in development mode to exclude the "django_bird/" prefix, matching the actual file paths in development environments. Production mode (DEBUG=False) still uses the prefix to maintain compatibility with collected static files.

## [0.17.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed static asset URLs to properly include the 'django_bird' prefix, ensuring URLs match the actual file paths during collection

## [0.17.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains some breaking changes. See the Removed section for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added `get_component_names_used_in_template` method to ComponentRegistry to access component names used in a template
- Added `get_component_assets` utility function to staticfiles.py to get assets for a component with optional filtering
- Added asset manifest system for optimized startup and rendering performance
- Added `manifest.py` module for generating, loading, and saving asset manifests
- Added management command `generate_asset_manifest` for pre-computing template-component relationships
- Added automatic fallback to component scanning in development mode (when DEBUG=True)

### Changed

- Improved static file collection to include assets from all component directories

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where assets from components with the same name in different directories weren't being properly collected
- Fixed template scanning on some platforms by improving error handling for invalid template files

### Removed

- Removed automatic component scanning at application startup for faster initialization
- Removed `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG` setting and autoconfiguration functionality (moved to django-bird-autoconf plugin)
- **Internal**: Removed `ComponentRegistry.discover_components` method.
- **Internal**: Removed `AutoConfigurator` class used for automatic setting configuration

## [0.16.2]

### Added

- Added new plugin hook `pre_ready` for handling initialization of library, but run before any internal setup. Needed for django-bird-autoconf to autoconfigure projects, e.g, add to template builtins.

### Fixed

- Added `app_settings.autoconfigure()` call back to the library's `ready` method, in order to preserve previous behavior before deprecation of autoconfiguration.

## [0.16.1]

### Added

- Added new plugin hook `ready` for handling application initialization during Django's application ready phase.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored app initialization to use internal plugin for autoconfiguration instead of in `AppConfig.ready()`.
- **Internal**: Changed a few internal development things related to type checking:
    - Added basedpyright to types `[dependency-group]` table in `pyproject.toml`, as well as a new nox session in `noxfile.py`.
    - Renamed `types` nox session to `mypy`.
    - Adjusted just recipes in `Justfile` to reflect the above.

### Deprecated

- The `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG` setting and autoconfiguration of the library and the Django project the library is installed in is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. The behavior has been moved to a new plugin, django-bird-autoconf, so if you wish to continue to allow autoconfiguration please install that library.

## [0.16.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains some breaking changes. See the Changed section for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added `AssetTypes` registry to manage different types of component assets.
- Added new plugin hook `register_asset_types` for registering custom asset types.
- Added new plugin hook `get_template_directories` for plugins to provide additional template directories for component discovery.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored `AssetType` from an `Enum` to a `dataclass`, to allow for creating new types of assets to register with the library.
- **Internal**: Replaced `LRUCache` with standard dict in `ComponentRegistry`, removing the `cachetools` dependency.
- **Internal**: Refactored template directory discovery to use plugin system, moving Django's default engine and app template directory handling to a new `django_bird.templates` plugin.
- **Breaking**: `BirdAssetFinder.find` now returns files from all component directories that match the requested path. Previously it incorrectly applied component template resolution precedence rules to static file paths.

### Fixed

- Improved performance by removing component discovery scanning from `BirdAssetFinder.find`.

## [0.15.0]

### Added

- Added plugin system infrastructure using `pluggy`.
- Added plugin hook for component asset collection.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored asset collection to use plugin system instead of directly in main library.
- **Internal**: Moved `Asset.from_path` functionality to the new file assets plugin.

## [0.14.2]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Created `BirdAssetStorage` to handle static file storage with custom prefixes and future CSS and JS scoping.
- Refactored component discovery by replacing two-pass approach (regex templatetag scan + template parsing) with single pass template parsing for more reliable detection of usage across all templates.
- Component discovery now done using `mulitprocessing.Pool`, hopefully mitigating the cost of full template parsing of all project templates on app initialization.

### Fixed

- Assets from components used in parent templates (via `{% extends %}` or `{% includes %}`) are now properly included when rendering child templates, due to component discovery change (see changed section above).

## [0.14.1]

### Fixed

- **Internal**: Removed the double registration of the `{% bird:var %}` and `{% endbird:var %}` tags.

## [0.14.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains some breaking changes. See the Removed section for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added the `{% bird:var %}` templatetag for managing local context variables within components, including support for appending, overwriting, and resetting values. Variables are scoped to components and automatically are cleaned up when the component finishes rendering, with optional explicit cleanup via `{% endbird:var %}`.

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated asset serving view (`asset_view`) and its URL configuration. Use `BirdAssetFinder` with Django's staticfiles app instead.
- Removed the deprecated `BirdLoader` template loader class.

## [0.13.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed static file URL generation to use correct relative paths when serving component assets through Django's static file storage system.

## [0.13.1]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored attribute value handling to use pattern matching for cleaner value resolution.
- **Internal**: Improved handling of quoted vs unquoted attribute values in component parameters.
- **Internal**: Simplified template tag parsing in `bird`, `bird:prop`, and `bird:slot` tags.
- **Internal**: Refactored component parameter handling to be more consistent across the codebase.

### Fixed

- Fixed asset URL generation to properly use Django's static file storage system instead of raw file paths.
- Fixed handling of data attributes in components to properly handle quotes and boolean values.

## [0.13.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains some breaking changes. See the Deprecated and Removed sections for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added `BirdAssetFinder`, a custom staticfiles finder to serve component assets through Django's staticfiles app.
- Added automatic configuration of `STATICFILES_FINDERS` to include `BirdAssetFinder` when `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG=True`.
- Added support for Django 5.2.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Renamed `TemplateConfigurator` to `AutoConfigurator` and consolidated configuration logic.
- **Internal**: Refactored component and asset loading strategy to track relationships between templates and components, affecting `ComponentRegistry.discover_components` and the `{% bird:asset %}` templatetag.

### Deprecated

- The built-in asset serving view (`asset_view`) is deprecated and will be removed in the next minor version (v0.14.0). Use `BirdAssetFinder` with Django's staticfiles app.
- The `BirdLoader` template loader is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. If you have enabled manual configuration by setting `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG=False`, please remove `django_bird.loader.BirdLoader` from your `TEMPLATES` setting.

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated `ENABLE_BIRD_ID_ATTR` setting.
- Removed automatically discovering templates in `BASE_DIR/templates`. Templates must now be in directories configured in Django's template engine settings or app template directories.
- Removed component scanning functionality from `BirdLoader`.
- Removed `django_bird.compiler.Compiler`.

### Fixed

- Fixed asset loading in `{% bird:asset %}` templatetags to only render assets from components actually used in the current template by tracking template-component relationships during component discovery.

## [0.12.1]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored slot handling logic by moving slot processing from `BirdNode` to `BoundComponent`.
- **Internal**: Simplified component context management in `BirdNode` by offloading context prep to `BoundComponent`.
- **Internal**: Refactored prop rendering in `Params` to take a `Component` instance instead of the raw `NodeList`.

### Removed

- **Internal**: Removed standalone `Slots` dataclass abstraction in favor of handling in `BoundComponent`.

### Fixed

- Fixed default slot content handling when using `only` keyword for component context isolation.

## [0.12.0]

### Added

- Added `data-bird-<component_name>` data attribute to the `attrs` template context variable for components when `ENABLE_BIRD_ATTRS` is enabled.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored component rendering by introducing a new `BoundComponent` class and moving some of the rendering logic from `Component` and `BirdNode` to this new class.
- Renamed `ENABLE_BIRD_ID_ATTR` setting to `ENABLE_BIRD_ATTRS` to reflect its expanded functionality.
- Moved setting the `data-bird-id` data attribute in the `attrs` template context variable to `BoundComponent` and added a sequence number to better uniquely identify multiple instances of the same component.

### Deprecated

- The `ENABLE_BIRD_ID_ATTR` setting is deprecated and will be removed in the next minor version (v0.13.0). Use `ENABLE_BIRD_ATTRS` instead.

### Removed

- **Internal**: Removed `Component.render` method in favor of new `BoundComponent.render` method.

## [0.11.2]

### Changed

- Improved component context handling by using `Context` objects directly when a component uses the outside template context, instead of flattening the context `dict`.
- **Internal**: Renamed `only` argument for `BirdNode` to `isolated_context`. This doesn't affect the public API of passing `only` to the template tag.
- Standardized component names to use dots instead of slashes for nested paths (e.g., "nested.button" instead of "nested/button").

## [0.11.1]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Changed component ID generation to use MD5 hash of name, path, and normalized source instead of Python's built-in hash function. This provides more consistent IDs across different Python processes.

## [0.11.0]

### Added

- Added `ENABLE_BIRD_ID_ATTR` setting (default: `True`) to control whether components receive an automatic `data-bird-id` attribute. This is to help with component identification in the DOM and for a future planned feature around JS/CSS asset scoping.

## [0.10.3]

### Fixed

- Fixed the potential for duplicate asset tags in the `{% bird:css %}` and `{% bird:js %}` templatetags by using a `set` instead of a `list` when collecting a template's component assets.

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored asset rendering logic by centralizing tag name parsing and HTML tag generation to the `django_bird.staticfiles` module.

## [0.10.2]

### Changed

- Changed asset URLs to use django-bird's asset view instead of file paths.

## [0.10.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed asset serving view to properly stream files using `FileResponse` instead of reading file contents directly.

## [0.10.0]

### Added

- Added built-in view and URLs for serving component assets in development. Note: This is not recommended for production use.

## [0.9.2]

### Changed

- Changed component name handling to preserve quotes, allowing literal string names to bypass dynamic resolution (e.g. `{% bird "button" %}` will always use "button" even if `button` exists in the context).

## [0.9.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed attribute name handling in components to properly convert underscores to hyphens (e.g. `hx_get` becomes `hx-get`) for better HTML compatibility.

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- Added `only` keyword to `{% bird %}` tag for isolating component context that, when used, components cannot access their parent template's context, e.g., `{% bird button only %}`.

### Changed

- Changed handling of self-closing indicator (`/`) in `{% bird %}` tag to always treat it as a syntax marker rather adding to the component's template context.

## [0.8.2]

### Fixed

- **Internal**: Fixed component caching behavior to properly track assets. Components are now always cached for asset tracking, while still providing fresh templates in `DEBUG` mode.

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed component discovery for nested directories and Django app templates.

## [0.8.0]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Consolidated Component and Asset registries into a single `ComponentRegistry`.
- **Internal**: Added component discovery at app startup instead of on-demand in the template loader.

### Fixed

- Fixed default content not being rendered in slots when no content is provided.

## [0.7.2]

### Changed

- **Internal**: Improved handling of component parameters in loops by creating fresh `Params` instances for each render. Previously, a single `Params` instance was reused across renders, which could cause issues with attribute resolution in loops. The `BirdNode` now stores raw attributes instead of a `Params` instance, and creates a new `Params` instance for each render.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where nested variable resolution (e.g., `item.url`) would fail in loops after the first iteration. This was caused by attributes being consumed during the first render and not being available for subsequent renders.

## [0.7.1]

### Removed

- **Internal**: Removed debug prints from `BirdNode` template tag node.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed

- Improved handling of quoted vs unquoted attribute values in `{% bird %}` components. Quoted values (e.g., `class="static-class"`) are treated as literal strings, while unquoted values (e.g., `class=dynamic_class`) are resolved from the template context. This allows for more explicit control over whether an attribute value should be treated as a literal or resolved dynamically.

### Fixed

- **Internal**: Simplified asset management by using a global registry, making it work reliably with any template loader configuration.

## [0.6.2]

### Changed

- When `DEBUG=True`, the `django_bird.components.Registry` will no longer cache the retrieval of `Component` instances.

## [0.6.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed a `TypeError` in the `BirdLoader` when scanning for assets if a `Template` or `Node` had a `None` nodelist. This could occur with self-closing `{% bird component / %}` components and their corresponding `BirdNode` instances.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- New `{% bird:css %}` and `{% bird:js %}` template tags to automatically include component assets
- Component assets are automatically discovered from matching CSS/JS files next to component templates

### Changed

- **Internal**: Extended `BirdLoader` to track component usage and their assets during template rendering
- **Internal**: Assets are now stored as frozensets for immutability
- **Internal**: Added `ComponentAssetRegistry` to manage component assets during template rendering
- **Internal**: Refactored `AssetType` to use string values and file extensions

### Removed

- **Internal**: Simplified asset handling by removing global registry in favor of per-component assets

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Added component caching with LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy via global `components` registry.
    - `cachetools>=5.5.0` is now a dependency of the library to support this new cache strategy

### Changed

- **Internal**: Flattened package structure by moving files from `components/` subdirectory to root level. No public API changes.
- **Internal**: `BirdNode` now uses cached components instead of creating new ones each time.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Improved handling of boolean attributes to support all forms of Django template syntax and string values. The attribute name alone (`disabled`), explicit booleans (`disabled=True`), or string values (`disabled="True"`) all work as expected - rendering just the attribute name when true and omitting it when false.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Created `{% bird:prop %}` tag for defining properties within components. These operate similarly to the `{{ attrs }}` template context variable, but allow for setting defaults. Any attributes passed to a component will override the prop's default value, and props defined in a component template are automatically removed from the component's `attrs`. Props are accessible in templates via the `props` context variable (e.g. `{{ props.id }}`)

## [0.2.0]

ðŸš¨ This release contains a breaking change. See the Changed section for more information. ðŸš¨

### Added

- Added support for dynamic component names in `{% bird %}` tag. Component names can now be variables, e.g. `{% bird component_type %}` where `component_type` is a variable in the template context.

### Changed

- Reversed template resolution order to prefer component-specific templates over generic ones.

  For example, given a component named `button`, the previous resolution order was:

  1. `button.html`
  2. `button/button.html`
  3. `button/index.html`

  The new resolution order is:

  1. `button/button.html`
  2. `button/index.html`
  3. `button.html`

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed rendering of flat attributes in `{% bird %}` component templates. Previously, a small mistake in trying to render `boolean` values caused no attributes to be rendered. E.g. `{% bird foo disabled=True %}` should have been rendered using `{{ attrs }}` inside the `foo` bird component as just `disabled` -- instead nothing was being rendered, even `key="value"` attributes.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Created `{% bird %}` tag for creating reusable components in Django templates.
- Created `{% bird:slot %}` tag for defining and using named slots within components.
- Included a custom template compiler for compilation and caching of Bird components. This is essentially a no-op for now and just there as a stub for future changes.
- Created a custom template loader for integration with django-bird's compiler and Django's template engine.
- Added support for nested components and dynamic slot rendering.
- Initial configuration of the library through the `settings.DJANGO_BIRD` dictionary, including these settings:
    - `COMPONENT_DIRS` - List of directories to search for components
    - `ENABLE_AUTO_CONFIG` - Boolean to enable/disable auto-configuration
